These jp_batch scripts are written to facilitate the automated processing of
neuroimaging data using Matlab wrappers. Currently they are focused on analyzing
fMRI data using SPM. The best place to find documentation is to start with the
jp_batch.m file.

These scripts are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but 
without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability
or fitness for a particular purpose.  Use at your own risk!
