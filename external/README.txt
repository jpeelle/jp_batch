The external folder has functions and files written by other people
but may be useful for you, or used by some of the other scripts. All
copyright and licensing is retained as distributed by the original
authors.

This folder (and subfolders) are automatically added if you run
JP_BATCH('addpaths') - beware conflicts with existing software
you have installed. When in doubt you can always add things by
hand (rather than using jp_batch('addpaths').

SOFTWARE/SCRIPTS INCLUDED:

# For timeseries image analysis from the CBU

tsdiffana.m

# For Donald McLaren's gPPI toolbox:
