These jp_batch scripts are written to facilitate the automated processing of
neuroimaging data using Matlab wrappers. Currently they are focused on analyzing
fMRI data using SPM. The best place to find documentation is to start with the
jp_batch.m file.

To get started, clone the git repository to your local drive:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/jpeelle/jp_batch.git
```

These scripts are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but 
without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability
or fitness for a particular purpose.  Use at your own risk!

Also note that some of the scripts, particularly in the utils folder, are
experimental, so take some care in using them.


# Future releases

Future updates to these scripts are unlikely; consider using AA instead:
