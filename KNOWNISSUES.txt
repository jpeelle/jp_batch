To override the use of JP_DEFAULTS to set default values, users can
set S.cfg.options.defsfunction to any matlab function. Currently this
will only work when initializing a study using JP_INIT; running
functions without using JP_INIT/JP_RUN will still use JP_DEFAULTS. Can
work around by creating a copy of JP_DEFAULTS in Matlab path that gets
called before the built-in defaults (test by typing 'which
jp_defaults' from the command line).

4d file support doesn't work yet...when it does, for 4d NIfti files, max number of volumes is 5000 (hard coded into jp_getfunimages). 

Still not confident realignunwarp is working well.

Tested on linux; most things would probably work on Windows, but some will probably fail (those requiring system commands to make softlinks or move/copy files).
